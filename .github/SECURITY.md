# Security Policy  ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
If you believe you have identified a security issue with a Nazli project, do not open a public issue. To responsibly report a security issue, use GitHub's security advisory system. From the project's repository, click "Security" at the top, then click "Advisories" at the left, then click the green "New draft security advisory" button. Alternatively, you may email kmgurmia@gmail.com, and we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also helpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue. You may include a name and link if you would like to be credited for the report.

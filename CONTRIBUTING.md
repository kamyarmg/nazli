### Adding New Fonts or Characters
Weâ€™re thrilled to see contributions that expand the versatility of the project!

- **Adding Characters:**
  1. Locate the `PIXEL_MAP` in `pixel_art.py`.
  2. Add a new character by defining its pixel grid as a list of strings. For example:
     ```python
     PIXEL_MAP["B"] = [
         "XXXXX",
         "X   X",
         "XXXXX",
         "X   X",
         "XXXXX",
     ]
     ```
  3. Verify your new character with test cases.

- **Adding New Fonts:**
  If you'd like to add a new pixel font style:
  1. Create a new dictionary with the character mappings.
  2. Include it in a way that users can switch between fonts easily.
  3. Ensure all characters in the font set are aligned and visually consistent.

Weâ€™re happy to guide you through the processâ€”feel free to ask questions by [opening an issue](https://github.com/kamyarmg/nazli/issues)!

### Improving Documentation
Documentation is just as important as the code itself! You can contribute by:
- Fixing typos or grammatical errors.
- Adding examples or explanations to make the project easier to understand.
- Updating the `README.md` or any other project documentation.

## Development Workflow

1. **Set up the development environment:**
   Ensure you have Python installed and all dependencies are configured using `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

2. **Test your changes:**
   Add unit tests for new features or modified code. We aim for high test coverage to maintain reliability.

3. **Lint your code:**
   Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python. Use tools like `ruff` to check for style violations:
   ```bash
   ruff
   ```

4. **Submit a pull request:**
   Include a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.
